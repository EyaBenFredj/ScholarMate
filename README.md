# 📚 ScholarMate – AI Research Paper Assistant

ScholarMate is an open-source, locally-running GenAI assistant that helps you **understand, analyze, and interact with research papers** using state-of-the-art language models, semantic search, and document parsing — all **100% free and private**.

> 🧠 Ask questions, get summaries, extract tables, generate flashcards — all from your own PDF research papers, with no paid API keys or cloud dependencies.

---

## 🎯 Features

✅ Upload any PDF research paper  
✅ Ask questions using RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)  
✅ Summarize entire sections (Abstract, Methods, Results, etc.)  
✅ ELI5 Mode: "Explain Like I’m 5" for simpler answers  
✅ Generate highlights and key insights  
✅ Create study flashcards (Q&A style)  
✅ Explain citations and references  
✅ Extract tables from PDF automatically  
✅ Compare two papers (similarity, methods, conclusions)  
✅ View full Q&A chat history  
✅ Fully offline – powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) + FAISS + Streamlit

## 🚀 Installation Guide (Windows / Linux / macOS)

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ScholarMate.git
cd ScholarMate
````

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # or source venv/bin/activate on macOS/Linux
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install and Start Ollama (Local LLM)

* Download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)
* Pull a model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

* Run the model:

```bash
ollama run llama3
```

Leave that terminal open – it runs your LLM backend locally.

### 5. Run ScholarMate

In a separate terminal (with virtual env activated):

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

## 🧪 Usage Examples

* "Summarize the abstract"
* "What is the main contribution of the paper?"
* "Explain the method section like I'm 5"
* "List key findings"
* "Create flashcards for this paper"
* "Compare this paper with another one"
* "Extract tables with results"

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Cost

* 💰 Free forever – no OpenAI or cloud API keys required
* 🔒 100% private – runs entirely on your device
* 📶 Offline-capable – LLM inference and vector search are local

---
